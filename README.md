Password Policy
===============
"Password Policy" is a generic extension which works well together with all extensions provided by OTRS AG. A SysConfig setting allows you to configure "Password Policy" (see more in the configuration options).

This extension is useful if strong password policies are needed, e. g. in CERT or financial environments.
